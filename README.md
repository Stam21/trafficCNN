# trafficCNN
A neural network that learns to classify traffic signs.

## Example
THe dataset used for this project is [gtsrb](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/gtsrb). After downloading the dataset you have to install any dependencies needed with :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can see how the neural network performs by running :

```
python traffic.py [dataset] [model.h5]
```
where dataset is the folder with all the data (gtsrb) and model.h5 is an optional argument to save the model.
